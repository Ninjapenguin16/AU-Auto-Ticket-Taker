# Installation Instructions
1. Download the latest release
2. Install the interception driver
   1. Run the helper batch script (Automates the installer)
   2. Reboot so the driver can be loaded
3. Run the main program

### Notes
The helper batch script just makes it so you don't have to mess with Command Prompt at all, the author of the driver locked it for use within that only for some reason
